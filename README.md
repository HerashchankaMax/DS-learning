| Project Title | Description | Libraries Used | Skills |
|:--------------|:------------|:----------------|:-------|
| [Borrower Reliability](https://github.com/BimMax/DS-learning/tree/main/project2.%20Credit%20scoring) | Based on available features (age, education, loan purpose, etc.) of previous bank clients, draw conclusions regarding borrower reliability | pandas, pymystem3, nltk | Data Preprocessing, EDA |
| [Mobile Operator Revenue](https://github.com/BimMax/DS-learning/tree/main/project3.Mobile_clients) | Using customer service usage statistics, provide recommendations to the marketing department for adjusting the advertising budget, as well as compare revenues across existing tariff plans | pandas, numpy, scipy, plotly | Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing |
| [Game Market Analysis](https://github.com/BimMax/DS-learning/tree/main/project4.Game_Market_Research) | Using data up to 2016, determine which platforms and game genres will be promising in 2017, and test hypotheses about the equality of user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms | pandas, numpy, scipy, plotly | Data Preprocessing, EDA, Data Visualization |
| [Tariff Plan Recommendation](https://github.com/BimMax/DS-learning/tree/main/project5.Tariffs_recomendation) | Based on client data where customers have already changed their tariff plan, build a model to determine whether a client should be recommended to switch tariffs | pandas, numpy, sklearn, plotly | Classification, Data Analysis, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier |
| [Bank Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/BimMax/DS-learning/tree/main/project6.Customer%20churn) | Build a model that predicts, based on historical client data, whether a customer will leave the bank or not | pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn | Classification, Data Analysis, OHE, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, Sampling |
| [Oil Well Location Selection](https://github.com/BimMax/DS-learning/tree/main/project7.Well_location) | Based on oil samples from three regions, determine the most profitable region for development | pandas, pandas_profiling, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, sklearn | Bootstrap, Risk Assessment, LinearRegression |
| [Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/BimMax/DS-learning/tree/main/project8.Predict_car_price) | Build a model to predict car prices for a mobile application | pandas, pandas_profiling, sklearn, lightGBM, XGboost, SGD | Regression, Data Preprocessing, EDA, Gradient Descent, Gradient Boosting, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor |
| [Taxi Orders Forecasting](https://github.com/BimMax/DS-learning/tree/main/project9.Taxi_order) | Based on historical taxi order data at airports, build a model to forecast the number of orders for the next hour | pandas, sklearn, matplotlib | Time Series, LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, LGBMRegressor |
| [Tweet Classification](https://github.com/BimMax/DS-learning/tree/main/project10.Tweets_classification) | An online store added a feature allowing users to edit product descriptions. For moderation, a tool is required to classify toxic comments | pandas, nltk, transformers, sklearn, LGBMClassifier | Classification, NLP, BERT, Stemming |
| [Age Detection](https://github.com/BimMax/DS-learning/blob/main/project11.Face%20age/project11_faces.ipynb) | For purchase analysis in a store, determine a personâ€™s age based on an image | pandas, seaborn, sklearn, tensorflow, keras | CV, Augmentation, ResNet50 |
